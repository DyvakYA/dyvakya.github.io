    People often ask for one of these. Here ya go.
    <div class="exp">
      Cassidy is a Senior Software Engineer making the web work at CodePen.
      She's worked for Amazon, L4 Digital, Clarifai, and Venmo, and graduated
      with a computer science degree from Iowa State University in 2014. She's
      had the honor of working with various organizations, including cKeys and
      Hacker Fund as their Director of Outreach. She's active in the developer
      community and one of Glamour Magazine's 35 Women Under 35 Changing the Tech
      Industry and LinkedIn's Top Professionals 35 &amp; Under. As an avid speaker,
      Cassidy has participated in meetups and events including the Grace Hopper
      Celebration for Women in Computing, SXSW, the National Center for Women &amp;
      IT Summit, TEDxDesMoines, the United Nations, and the U.S.A. Science and
      Engineering Festival. She wants to inspire generations of STEM students
      to be the best they can be, and her favorite quote is from Helen Keller:
      "One can never consent to creep when one feels an impulse to soar." She
      loves mechanical keyboards and karaoke.

    If you have any questions about me or you just want to send me a joke,
    take a look at any of my profiles listed on this site.
    <br><br>
    Thanks for reading this far. In exchange for your seemingly undying
    loyalty, here is a joke: There are two types of programming languages: 
    those that people constantly criticize, and those that no one uses.
